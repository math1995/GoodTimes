== ABOUT NATIONAL BASIC ==

Create a truly unique design with National Basic, a lightweight and fully responsive HTML5 theme. Use the Customizer to add your own header image, page layout, site width and more. Distinguish each post with one of the eight supported post formats, such as: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Install JetPack to display each of your galleries through a tiled view and jQuery carousel. Compatible with bbPress & BuddyPress. Built using SASS, Compass and Bootstrap 3. Uses Google Fonts for improved typeface readability. Designed for desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://demos.bavotasan.com/national/.

== NOTES ==

* If you have a drop down list for your site navigation, the parent item should only be a grouping title with a "#" value for the URL parameter. The Bootstrap navbar requires a click to open the drop down list so any link that is set in the parent item will not work.
* The large block of text below the header image is a Text widget added to the Jumbo Headline section.
* The three boxes on the home page are Icon & Text widgets added to the Home Page Top Area.
* A sticky post requires a featured image in order for it to appear in the sticky block on the home page.
